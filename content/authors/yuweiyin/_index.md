Yuwei is a PhD student in the [UBC NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.ubc.ca/) at the Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia (Vancouver :canada:). His research primarily centers on artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP).
Previously, he conducted research on *Multilingual NLP* \[[1](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-short.31/), [2](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.260/), [3](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0618), [4](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0619), [5](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.34/), [6](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9944969), [7](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30675-4_34), [8](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.522/), [9](https://aclanthology.org/2024.lrec-main.948/), [10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417424016270)\] and *Multimodal NLP* \[[11](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08821), [12](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04387), [13](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00065), [14](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.198/), [15](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.100/), [16](https://aclanthology.org/2024.sigdial-1.1/), [17](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UunCPtPOlZ)\].
Currently, he is focusing on ***mindful thinking*** and ***logical reasoning*** in AI systems \[[18](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04689), [19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21544), [20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22887)\], aiming to bridge the gap between artificial and human intelligence by instilling ***cognitive insights*** into intelligent agents.
