Mr. Yuwei Yin is a natural language processing (NLP) researcher in the HKU NLP Group at the Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong (HKU CS).

His research interest lies in natural language understanding & generation, multilingual NLP, and interpretable NLP. Accordingly, his research goals are mainly three folds: 1. to improve the understanding and generating ability of general NLP models; 2. to tap the potential of multilingual NLP in a broader scenario; 3. to fathom the essence of NLP models and make them more interpretable, understandable, and controllable.

What do we really mean by understanding? How exactly do we humans make sentences? How can computers do what we can do in terms of language? What does multilinguality mean to us? How can we break the language barrier to promote peace in the world? The discovery and explanation of human beings, nature, and the universe drive him to embark on a fascinating lifelong research journey.
