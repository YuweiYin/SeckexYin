# Mr. Yuwei Yin is an artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) researcher in the [UBC NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.ubc.ca/) at the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, University of British Columbia. Currently, his research interest is natural language processing on multilingualism (translation) and multimodality (grounding & embodied AI). His long-term goal is to build a versatile instant translator of all languages and modalities for breaking language barriers, facilitating communication, and rebuilding the Tower of Babel--gathering the intelligence of us all to achieve something supreme. He is also fascinated with the preliminary idea of free-will programming in order to advance toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He is glad to discuss these interdisciplinary matters with researchers of various backgrounds. Feel free to reach out. ([MISC](https://yuweiyin.github.io/))

# Mr. Yuwei Yin is a graduate student in the [UBC NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.ubc.ca/) at the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, University of British Columbia. Currently, his research interest is to realize automatic natural language understanding by delving into multilingual (breaking the language barrier), multimodal (exploring the universal representation), and embodied AI (building the world model), focusing on human understanding and language acquisition mechanisms with the help of interdisciplinary clues from linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, biology, and more. His long-term goal is to empower AI with a brain on par with human intelligence (if it exists) and let AI, as a tool or interface, enable people to know human beings better and explore the magnificent universe. Feel free to reach out. ([MISC](https://yuweiyin.github.io/))
