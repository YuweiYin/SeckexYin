# Mr. Yuwei Yin is an artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) researcher in the [UBC NLP Group](http://nlp.cs.ubc.ca/) at the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, University of British Columbia. Currently, his research interest is natural language processing on multilingualism and multimodality. His long-term goal is to build a versatile instant translator of all languages and modalities for breaking language barriers, facilitating communication, and rebuilding the Tower of Babel--gathering the intelligence of us all to achieve something supreme. He is also fascinated with the preliminary idea of free-will programming in order to advance toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He is open to discussing these interdisciplinary matters with researchers of various backgrounds. ([MISC](https://yuweiyin.github.io/))
